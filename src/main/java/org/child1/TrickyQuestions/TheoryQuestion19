Why are wrapper classes immutable in Java?

Wrapper classes (like Integer, Double, Boolean, etc.) are immutable for several
important reasons:

Consistency with primitives: Wrapper classes represent primitive values (int, double,
etc.), which themselves do not change. Immutability ensures the wrapper’s value remains
consistent with the primitive it wraps.

Thread-safety:Immutable objects can be safely shared between threads without
synchronization, preventing concurrency issues.

Caching and performance:Java caches frequently used wrapper objects (like Integer
values from -128 to 127). Immutability ensures these cached objects are safe to reuse
without risk of their value changing.

Reliable behavior:Immutability prevents unexpected changes, making wrapper objects
predictable and reliable when used as keys in collections or in other contexts.

In short:
Wrapper classes are immutable to ensure thread-safety, enable safe caching, maintain
consistency with primitives, and provide reliable, predictable behavior in Java programs.
