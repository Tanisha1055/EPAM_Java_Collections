Is HashMap made up of Hashtable?

No, HashMap is NOT made up of Hashtable.

HashMap and Hashtable are two separate implementations of the Map interface.
HashMap does not use Hashtable internally.
Both use a similar underlying data structure (an array of buckets with linked lists or
trees for collision handling), but they are implemented independently.

Why is HashMap not thread-safe?

HashMap was designed for performance and non-synchronized use cases.
It does not synchronize its methods, so multiple threads can modify it at the same time,
leading to data corruption or unpredictable behavior.

If you need a thread-safe map, you should use:

Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())
ConcurrentHashMap (preferred for most concurrent use cases)
